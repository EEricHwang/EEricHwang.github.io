permalink: /publication/tempAD
excerpt: 'An anomaly is a rare event with a potential for a meaningful operational or safety related risk.  To assist air traffic controllers (ATCs) with airspace operation while ensuring high efficiency and safety, it is important to understand aircraft anomalies as observed by ATCs, and to analyze how operational anomalies are monitored. Modern data-mining and time-series data analysis techniques are powerful tools to generate anomaly detection models through machine learning, so that normal and abnormal time-series data can be identified. In this paper, we propose a temporal logic based learning algorithm that can generate data driven models for anomaly detection in the terminal airspace operations, which are easy to be interpreted in natural language and can express system properties such as human-readable bounds on time and physical parameters, thereby facilitating human feedback.  The proposed algorithm is demonstrated with real terminal airspace surveillance data, obtained from Airport Surface Detection Equipment - Model X (ASDE-X) and Terminal Automation Information Service (TAIS) datasets.'
