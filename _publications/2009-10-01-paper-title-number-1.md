excerpt: 'An anomaly is a rare event with a potential for a meaningful operational or safety relatedrisk.  To assist air traffic controllers (ATCs) with airspace operation while ensuring highefficiency and safety, it is important to understand aircraft anomalies as observed by ATCs, andto analyze how operational anomalies are monitored. Modern data-mining and time-series dataanalysis techniques are powerful tools to generate anomaly detection models through machinelearning, so that normal and abnormal time-series data can be identified. In this paper, wepropose a temporal logic based learning algorithm that can generate data driven models foranomaly detection in the terminal airspace operations, which are easy to be interpreted innatural language and can express system properties such as human-readable bounds on timeand physical parameters, thereby facilitating human feedback.  The proposed algorithm isdemonstrated with real terminal airspace surveillance data, obtained from Airport SurfaceDetection Equipment - Model X (ASDE-X) and Terminal Automation Information Service (TAIS) datasets.'
