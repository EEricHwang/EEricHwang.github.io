My research focuses on the development of control strategies for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) within the aerial engineering domain. I'm particularly interested in augmenting the <strong> robustness </strong> and <strong> resilience </strong> of these systems, recognizing their critical role in ensuring overall system safety.
