I have been at Aptiv since March 2020 as an Object Tracking Developer under the umbrella of the Advanced Safety team at Troy, Michigan. My role primarily involves developing software-based solutions to support downstream threat assesment algorithms, by performing reliable multi-sensor fusion.

Sensor fusion is the ability to bring together inputs from multiple radars, lidars and cameras to form a single model or image of the environment around a vehicle. The resulting model is more accurate because it balances the strengths of the different sensors. Vehicle systems can then use the information provided through sensor fusion to support more-intelligent actions. In the same vein, my role involves multi-sensor multi-target tracking algorithms' design and implementation, where the inputs come from several cameras and radars. In a broad sense, the output of object tracking comprises of complete environmental awareness of the host vehicle, such as position and velocities of other vehicles, pedestrians, and barriers around it.

This output is then used to support intelligent active driver assistance systems, such as adaptive cruise control, lane-keeping, collision warning and braking, etc; taking steps toward minimal driver engagement and autonomy.
