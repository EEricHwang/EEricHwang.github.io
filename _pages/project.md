NASA Secure and Safe Assured Autonomy (S2A2) Project

<div id="dots" style="display:inline"> <strong> Overview: </strong> 
In the future of unmanned systems, there will be a blending of various types of unmanned aerial systems (UAS), personal air vehicles, urban air mobility (UAM) vehicles, and specialized mission aircraft within the National Airspace System (NAS). These advancements can utilize progress in UAS Traffic Management (UTM) specifically tailored for the distinct demands of UAM airspace control. Supported by NASAâ€™s Aeronautics University Leadership Initiative (ULI), this project aims to develop new technologies/algorithms to ensure the safe and robust integration of autonomous vehicles into a UAM-tailored transportation infrastructure.  </div>

In contrast to single-agent systems, MASs exhibit a distinctive feature wherein the functionality and mission execution of MASs are profoundly reliant on inter-agent communication. For instance, in the context of UAM, the major tasks of aerial vehicles (AVs) in an urban environment would be cargo delivery, passenger transportation, and medical service. To increase operational efficiency, AVs will maintain formation control by sharing their vehicle's information (e.g., position and velocity) to achieve it.

Nevertheless, strong reliance on communication between AVs could give rise to system vulnerabilities toward cyberattacks (e.g., denial-of-service (DoS), false-data-injection (FDI), stealthy attacks, etc.). These malicious incursions may disrupt the integrity of information exchange among AVs, potentially jeopardizing their abilities to achieve their designed tasks. Consequently, in the MAS, computer science, and control communities, numerous research have been conducted to reactively mitigate/reduce the detrimental effects of cyber threats.
