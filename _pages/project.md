NASA Secure and Safe Assured Autonomy (S2A2) Project

<div id="dots" style="display:inline"> <strong> Overview </strong> have received great attention thanks to their capabilities to perform difficult/complex missions compared to single-agent systems. Each agent of a MAS has a distributed control protocol based on the local information obtained from its neighbors, which allows the MAS to be scalable and efficient. These advantages have led to the prosperous development of MAS engineering applications, such as multi-robots, autonomous vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs). Nevertheless, system <strong> vulnerability </strong> of MASs to malicious threats, particularly in the form of cyberattacks, can pose a substantial concern. These threats have the potential to compromise the performance and overall safety of MASs. As such, there arises a need to develop a risk assessment methodology for MASs operating in the presence of cyberattacks. Such an approach is critical for enhancing the <strong> security </strong> and <strong> safety </strong> of MASs. </div>
