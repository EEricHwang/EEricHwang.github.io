Secure and Safe Assured Autonomy for Urban Air Mobility
------
<p> 
<strong>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</strong><br>
<strong>Research Periods:</strong> Aug 2021 - Aug 2025 <br>
Our objective is to develop a vehicle-level advanced control algorithm for urban air mobility (UAM) applications. This allows UAM aerial vehicles (AVs) to achieve more safe and secure operations even though AVs are exposed to adversarial environments, including disturbances, systematic uncertainties, and cyberattacks. I am particularly focusing on developing cyber threat management algorithms, such as attack mitigation and risk assessment for multiple AVs. My work is based on control-theoretical approaches (e.g., Kalman filter, control barrier function, and Lyapunov stability criterion) to fully guarantee AVs' safety and security.
