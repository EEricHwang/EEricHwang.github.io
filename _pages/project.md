Secure and Safe Assured Autonomy for Urban Air Mobility
------
<p> 
<strong>National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)</strong><br>
<strong>Research Periods:</strong> Aug 2021 - Aug 2025 <br>
Our objective is to develop a vehicle-level advanced control algorithm for urban air mobility (UAM) applications. This allows UAM aerial vehicles (AVs) to achieve more safe and secure operations even though AVs are exposed to adversarial environments, including disturbances, systematic uncertainties, and cyberattacks. I am particularly focusing on developing cyber threat management algorithms, such as attack mitigation and risk assessment for multiple AVs. My work is based on control-theoretical approaches (e.g., Kalman filter, control barrier function, and Lyapunov stability criterion) to fully guarantee AVs' safety and security.

Development of Eco-Adaptive Cruise Control (Eco-ACC) Method for Class-8 Heavy Trucks
------
<p> 
<strong> Summer 2025 Internship at Cummins </strong><br>
<strong>Research Periods:</strong> May 2025 - Aug 2025 <br>
As a PhD Research Intern at Cumminsâ€™ Connected and Intelligent Systems group, I led the design and implementation of real-time predictive control algorithms aimed at improving both safety and energy efficiency for Class 8 semi-trucks. My work centered on the development of an Eco-Adaptive Cruise Control (Eco-ACC) system powered by Cummins Power Systems, where I applied a model predictive control (MPC) framework to optimize vehicle performance. By incorporating predictive strategies that account for road grade and interactions with preceding vehicles, I was able to demonstrate meaningful improvements in fuel economy while enhancing operational safety under diverse driving conditions.
