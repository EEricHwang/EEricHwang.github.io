Hello all!

I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE), advised by Prof. Inseok Hwang. I am interested in safety-critical control for autonomous systems, which show high-assured safety and security. For my Ph.D. studies, I have been developing vehicle-level cyber threat management algorithms, including attack mitigation and risk assessment, for aerospace system applications. My techniques mainly include 1) model-based reachability analysis, 2) robust control theory, 3) control barrier function, and 4) distributed optimization and control.

For a more comprehensive overview of my work, please refer to his [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfoiL3WSCRDaNayPMSjwQfOM4LnIjxmh/view?usp=drive_link) (updated Sep. 2024).

Thank you for visiting!
