I am a PhD student at the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE), advised by Dr. Inseok Hwang. I am interested in <strong> safety-critical control for autonomous systems with high-assured safety </strong>. For my Ph.D. studies, I have been developing vehicle-level cyber threat management algorithms, including attack mitigation and risk assessment, for aerial system applications. My <strong>technical skills</strong> mainly include:

 <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
     <li> Model-based reachability computation and analysis </li>
     <li> State feedback control and estimation </li>
     <li> Robust control theory </li>
     <li> Control barrier function </li>
     <li> Distributed optimization and control </li>
 </ul>

For a more comprehensive overview of my work, please refer to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/11QUgC7uMvu0lk0fjNXlfH3MGzSu-iNpQ/view?usp=sharing) (updated Aug. 2025).
