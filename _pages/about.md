Greeting,

My name is Eric Hwang, and I'm a Ph.D. student at the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE). My primary research interest lies in the development of safe and resilient control methodologies for cyber-physical systems in the aerospace engineering domain. Before joining the [Flight Dynamics & Control/ Hybrid Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/fdchsl/home), at Purdue University, I attained my bachelor's degree at Kwangwoon University in South Korea, and I earned my master's degree at Yonsei University in South Korea. Throughout the course of my academic career, my primary field of focus has consistently revolved around robotics and electrical engineering, with and strong emphasis on control theory, advanced mathematics, and hardware implementations. For a more comprehensive overview of my professionalism, please refer to my [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfoiL3WSCRDaNayPMSjwQfOM4LnIjxmh/view?usp=drive_link).

Thank you for visiting my homepage!
