Hello! I am a developer in the Object Tracker team at APTIV in Troy, Michigan. My work typically focuses on design and implementation for sensing and perception modules for software-based automotive autonomy solutions, which is a part of Aptiv's [Active Safety & User Experience](https://www.aptiv.com/solutions/advanced-safety) deliverables. I earned my Ph.D. and masters in the [Flight Dynamics & Control/ Hybrid Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/fdchsl/home) at Purdue University, and my bachelors degree at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.ae.iitkgp.ac.in/) in India.

<hr>
For all my degrees, I have majored in aerospace/aeronautical engineering, with a focus in control, estimation, and aircraft dynamics. The [research page](/research) details almost all the probing I have done during my graduate degrees, focusing on distributed estimation and machine learning applications. All publications produced as a result of this research are in the [publications page](/publications). Details about my work experience are in the [work exp. page](/work) - be it things I do at Aptiv, or my intern back at IIT Kharagpur. All this is more or less summarized in my CV which you can pull off from the [CV page](/cv).
