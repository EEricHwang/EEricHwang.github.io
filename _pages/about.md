Hello all.

I am a Ph.D. student at the School of Aeronautics and Astronautics at [Purdue University](https://engineering.purdue.edu/AAE), advised by Prof. Inseok Hwang. I am interested in <strong> safety-critical control for autonomous systems with high-assured safety </strong>. For my Ph.D. studies, I have been developing vehicle-level cyber threat management algorithms, including attack mitigation and risk assessment, for aerial system applications. My <strong>techniques</strong> mainly include:

 <ul style="list-style-type:square;">
     <li> Model-based reachability computation and analysis </li>
     <li> State feedback control and estimation </li>
     <li> Robust control theory </li>
     <li> Control barrier function </li>
     <li> Distributed optimization and control </li>
 </ul>

For a more comprehensive overview of my work, please refer to his [CV](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KfoiL3WSCRDaNayPMSjwQfOM4LnIjxmh/view?usp=drive_link) (updated Sep. 2024).
