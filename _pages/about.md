Hello! I am a developer in the Object Fusion team at APTIV in Troy, Michigan. My work typically focuses on design and implementation for sensing and perception modules for software-based automotive autonomy solutions, which is a part of Aptiv's [Advanced Safety & User Experience](https://www.aptiv.com/solutions/advanced-safety) deliverables. I earned my Ph.D. and masters in the [Flight Dynamics & Control/ Hybrid Systems Lab](https://sites.google.com/view/fdchsl/home) at Purdue University, and my bachelors degree at [IIT Kharagpur](http://www.ae.iitkgp.ac.in/) in India. During all my degrees, I have majored in aerospace/aeronautical engineering, with a focus on control, estimation, and aircraft dynamics.

The [research page](/research) details almost all the probing I have done during my graduate degrees, focusing on distributed estimation and machine learning applications. All publications produced as a result of this research are in the [publications page](/publications). Details about my work at Aptiv are in the [work exp. page](/work). All this is more or less summarized in my CV which you can pull off from the [CV page](/cv).

During my free time, I play tennis, basketball, badminton, and squash as an amateur. With the pandemic curbing these activities, some friends and I have got a newfound interest in playing board games and tabletop RPG games. It has been a slippery slope of buying newer and more complex games, which has led to a never-ending race between buying new games (just got Leaving Earth!), and playing them all; the list of games I own and have played can be found [here](https://boardgamegeek.com/collection/user/chocopie9). I am the DM for several D&D campaigns, and a level-3 Paladin in one ([smite!](/images/smite.jpg)). I also try to play some guitar and the bass, and enjoy listening to prog.
