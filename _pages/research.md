My research endeavors focus on the development of control strategies tailered for cyber-physical systems (CPSs) within the realm of aerial engineering. I'm dedicated to enhancing the <strong> robustness </strong> and <strong> resilience </strong> of control systems in aerial engineering applications. These systems are of paramount importance since they bear direct implications for human safety. 

The design and implementation of aerial engineering control systems necessitate sophisticated solutions owing to their heightened intricacy and the paramount importance of safety considerations. Absent these solutions, a multitude of risks to human life and property damage would ensue. For instance, modern aerial control systems, like those utilized in Urban Air Mobility (UAM), place a substantial reliance on the uninterrupted flow of information enabled by communication networks (such as 5G, 6G, Wi-Fi, etc.), which connect aerial vehicles (AVs) to ground control stations. Nonetheless, these communication networks could be vulnerable to cyberattacks, potentially resulting in detrimental scenarios, such as collisions and accidents involving AVs.

As a devoted control engineer, my overarching objective throughout my Ph.D. studies is to ensure the safety and optimal performance of these aerial systems, in the presence of malicious threats. I'm committed to addressing the challenges posed by intricate interplay between technology, safety, and performance in the context of control theory and aerial engineering.
